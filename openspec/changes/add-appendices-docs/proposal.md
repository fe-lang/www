# Change: Add Appendices Documentation

## Why
The Appendices section provides essential reference material for Fe developers. This includes keyword reference, built-in types, intrinsics, selector calculation, and migration guides for developers coming from Solidity or Rust.

## What Changes
- Document all Fe keywords with descriptions and usage
- Document built-in types (numeric types, bool, String, etc.)
- Document intrinsic functions available in Fe
- Document selector calculation method with examples
- Create migration guide for Solidity developers
- Create migration guide for Rust developers

## Impact
- Affected specs: `documentation`
- Affected code: `src/content/docs/appendix/*.md` (6 files, replacing placeholder content)
- Target audience: Developers needing quick reference and those migrating from other languages
