:::caution[No Release Available]
Fe is currently under active development and there is no installable release available. The last published release is over two years old and does not reflect the current state of the language documented here.
:::

## Current Status

The Fe compiler has undergone intensive rework over the past two years, introducing significant improvements including:

- A new effect system for explicit capability tracking
- Message-based contract interfaces
- Enhanced type system with traits and generics
- Improved tooling (formatter, language server, package manager)

This documentation covers these upcoming features.

## Following Development

Until a new release is available, you can follow Fe's development:

- **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/argotorg/fe](https://github.com/argotorg/fe) - Watch for releases and follow development
- **Build from Source**: Advanced users can build the compiler from the repository's main branch

## What's Next

Once a release is available, this page will include:

- Binary downloads for major platforms
- Package manager installation (cargo, brew, etc.)
- Verification steps
- IDE setup instructions

For now, continue reading to learn about Fe's design and features. When the release is ready, you'll be prepared to start building.
