Fe is a statically typed language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that blends Rust-like syntax with an innovative message-passing paradigm tailored to the platform. It offers a complete, batteries-included toolchain, featuring a built-in package manager, formatter, and robust language server to streamline development. Designed for safety and correctness, Fe empowers developers with features like generics, traits, pattern matching, and even higher-kinded types, while ensuring a smooth, modern developer experience. It serves as a secure foundation for building the next generation of decentralized applications.
